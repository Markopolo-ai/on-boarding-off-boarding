# Figma- UI/UX Design

I am not comformatble with UI/UX design as i have worked as developer and i have no plan to be an UI/UX designer. Still i would have prepared the UI/UX
But the timeframe wasn't sufficient to implement all the features.

#  React- Frontend part

Frontend is done through following the best practices of React and Redux.
There has a list view to view all employee with their basic info. Admin will remove the github access through clicking on the button. 
He can also redo the access for the employee if he want by firing the click event on the button.
Not all event are working as expected but i have planned the frontend for better user experience and robustness.

# Serverless - Backend

For serverless backend, used netlify functions which use aws lambda under the hood.
  Features:
	1. Connected to mongodb cluster to store user and other info that can be used by the frontend for future uses.
	2. Connected to react frontend to communicate and build a secure pipeline to transfer data and process event request.
	3. For now, Github authentication system is implemented. 
		We can invite new collaborator through email.
		We can remove access to collaborator fron organization
