# On Boarding Off Boarding

In this project I have made a google drive folder management web application. It will used to view list of users currently have access to a folder, add a user to that folder and revoke permission to access that folder for any existing user. All of this would be done with a single click. Meaning, adding or removing user from the drive folder with just a single click of a button. 

## Status
This project able to function fully with the mentioned field. However, it is still in development phase and I wish to enable drive like feature here. Since, it is only accessible my a manager who will control drive access to the user, I want to add option for user to login also to the application and view the folders they have been given access to with a UI similar to google drive for ease of use. 

## Setup and Requirement

The project is splitted into frontend and backend. The *drive_api* is the backend and *drive-access-frontend* is the frontend part of this project.
